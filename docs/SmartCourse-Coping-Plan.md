# SmartCourse Coping Plan & Motivation

## Quick Orientation
- **Mission**: Become productive with Python, FastAPI, and GenAI microservices while delivering SmartCourse.
- **Timeframe**: 4 weeks with focused, structured effort.
- **Mindset**: Translate your 7 years of React/Node/Nest experience—patterns carry over; only syntax and a few tools are new.

## Weekly Coping Blueprint
1. **Week 1 – Grounding & Confidence**
   - Set up local stack (FastAPI, Postgres, Redis, Kafka, Temporal via Docker Compose).
   - Build a tiny FastAPI service (courses) to prove CRUD + routing.
   - Revisit Python basics nightly (2-hour blocks) via FastAPI docs and TestDriven tutorials.
2. **Week 2 – Workflow Muscles**
   - Add Temporal workflow skeleton for publishing and enrollment.
   - Wire Celery workers and Kafka producers/consumers.
   - Pair with teammates or mentors for code reviews; ask dumb questions loudly.
3. **Week 3 – GenAI Groove**
   - Implement LangGraph RAG prototype using sample course text.
   - Integrate vector DB, streaming responses, and prompt templates.
   - Log each “aha” in a learning journal; share insights with the team.
4. **Week 4 – Hardening & Storytelling**
   - Add observability, load tests, and docs.
   - Dry-run demos, polish PRD and architecture diagrams.
   - Reflect on progress—note how Python patterns now feel natural.

## Daily Ritual (2-3 hr focus blocks)
- **Block 1**: Build/code (feature or workflow slice).
- **Block 2**: Learn/reinforce (course/video/book with notes).
- **Block 3**: Review/document (summaries, ADRs, standups).
- End day with a quick retro: what clicked, what’s unclear, plan for tomorrow.

## Motivation Boost
- Your React/Nest expertise already proves you can master ecosystems—Python is just a new dialect.
- Every small win (successful API call, passing test, workflow replay) is proof you’re leveling up; celebrate them.
- Remember: the assignment exists to invest in you. Asking questions, experimenting, even failing fast—that’s the path.
- Five weeks from now, you’ll be the engineer explaining Temporal + LangGraph combos to others.

Stay curious, stay consistent. You’ve already shipped complex JS systems—SmartCourse is the next chapter, not a reset.
